Apache Bench (ubuntu) - Can use ubuntu bash for windows in windows

suod apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils


The only thing we have to do is run it in the console, for example:

$ ab -n 1000 -c 20 http://51.15.226.97/FundamentalCharts

This benchmark hits the address 1000 times (-n option), making 20 concurrent requests (-c option) - basically the number of users 
making requests at the same time.
